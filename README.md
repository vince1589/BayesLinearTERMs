# BayesLinearTERMs

Script in some order

transform_normalize_etabx.ipynb -> Will create all the file to transform etabx (dtermen) to some pep-recep interaction

make_SORTCERY_test.ipynb -> Transform SORTCERY data in cluster (k-means). Idea is that can we learn information  from one sequence space that share a small (but maybe important) space with another seq space

sortecery_pep_recep.ipynb -> Run the PYMC3. This is just an example, could be auto for the server

analyse_data.ipynb -> How to load data
